# Testing!
Heyyyyyyyyy

Learning to use GitHub Desktop.

Hope it's easy!

Okay, so basically, Github Desktop monitors the staging area for changes,
and when you're ready to publish a change or set of changes, you write a
summary and description, hit commit, and then when you're ready to sync
to the server, you hit sync.

That seems pretty easy.
